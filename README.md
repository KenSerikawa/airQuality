### This is an example of implementing an external API service with Symfony5 and displaying the response on a basic template

1. Clone repo 
2. Launch server:
```
# Native php server
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 public/index.php

# Web server bundle
bin/console server:start
```
3. Once you get into the route `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` try typing your city on the input and submit it.
